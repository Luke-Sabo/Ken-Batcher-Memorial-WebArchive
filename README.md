# DEPLOYMENT
  1.) Follow all standard practices regarding Github pull requests:
      a.) Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end layer when doing a build.
      b.) Update the README.md with details of change to the interface, this includes new enviornment variables, exposed ports, 
          useful file locations, and container parameters.
      c.) Increase the version number for any example files and the README.md to the new version that this pull request would represent. 
          The versioning scheme we use is SemVer (https://semver.org/)
      d.) You may merge the Pull Request in only once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do           that, you may request the second reviewer merge it for you.
